            Rick, in a drunken state, takes his grandson, Morty, for a ride in his flying car and rambles on about how
            he
            plans to use a neutrino bomb to wipe out all life on Earth. Rick lands the vehicle on Morty's demand and
            passes
            out. The bomb activates by itself and seems to be left unchecked, but ultimately it is shown that life on
            Earth
            remains intact. After having breakfast with their family, Rick takes Morty to another dimension to collect
            seeds
            of "Mega Trees", which Morty is forced to hide in his own rectum to get past intergalactic customs. However,
            Rick and Morty's cover is blown and they escape while engaging in a shootout with alien insects. Ultimately,
            the
            seeds briefly cause Morty to be highly intelligent, despite the fact that he missed a semester of school
            because
            he's been in adventures with Rick. This causes his parents to believe he is fine with his education, but
            this
            wastes the seeds, so Rick informs Morty that they need to go back and get more, while their aftereffects
            leave
            Morty writhing on the floor.

            On Jerry's demand, Rick gives Snuffles, the family dog, an intelligence-enhancing helmet. Rick and Morty, in
            an
            Inception-esque scenario, enter the dream of Morty's teacher, in an attempt to make him give Morty an "A" in
            math class. They find themselves in a dangerous situation, where they are forced to repeatedly enter dreams
            within dreams to escape. Eventually, they are chased by a dream character named Scary Terry, a "legally
            safe"
            parody of Freddy Krueger. They manage to enter his dream, where they stand up for him against his bully
            teacher.
            This persuades Scary Terry to help them complete their mission. Meanwhile, at home, Snuffles builds a
            mechanical
            suit and assembles a dog army intending to take over Earth. Returning home from their adventure, Rick and
            Morty
            enter Snuffles' dream, where Rick causes Morty to fall into a coma. This prompts Snuffles to rethink his
            priorities, resulting in him taking his army to another planet.

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="e3" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="e3-tab"><p>
            On Christmas, Rick sends Morty inside the body of a homeless man to save his life (a parody of Fantastic
            Voyage). Inside the man's body is a microscopic enclosure called Anatomy Park (a parody of Jurassic Park),
            which
            houses various deadly diseases that escape their enclosures. Morty and one of the park staff, Annie, flee
            from
            the rampaging diseases as they kill the rest of the base staff. Rick rescues them by enlarging the homeless
            man's body before destroying it in an explosion. Back at the family home, Jerry's parents visit, and the
            family
            attempts to bond without electronic devices. Jerry is dismayed to discover his parents have decided to
            experiment in polyamory.

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="e4" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="e4-tab"><p>
            Aliens hold Rick and Jerry captive in a virtual reality, in an attempt to steal Rick's recipe for
            Concentrated Dark Matter. As Rick attempts escape, he discovers that there are multiple virtual reality
            layers on top of each other. Jerry, on the other hand, despite numerous system glitches, remains completely
            oblivious, and keeps trying to sell his advertising slogan for apples. Rick finally games the aliens by
            giving them a fake recipe. The aliens send Rick and Jerry on their way, and their ship explodes as they
            prepare the concoction.
            Post-credits scene: Jerry is fired on the spot after debuting his new advertising slogan for apples in the
            real world. At night, a drunk Rick enters Morty's room, starts showing appreciation for him, but quickly
            turns on him with a knife and demands to know if Morty is a simulation. Rick then apologizes before passing
            out.
